<p>This class is a slower-paced introductory mathematics course intended and highly recommended for non-concentrators in the math (and general STEM) departments. It serves as a good fulfilment of a math requirement and may not be taken in combination to MATH 0070 or MATH 0090. Topics include, but are not limited to functions, graphing functions, limits, an intro to differentiation and integration, and the mean value theorem.</p>
