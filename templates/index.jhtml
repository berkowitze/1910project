    <h3>Intro Math Courses at Brown</h3>
    <div class='intro'>
        <p>There are dozens of introductory level math and applied math courses at Brown. Figuring out which ones you're qualified for and deciding which one to take can be extremely frustrating. Hopefully this site can help you figure out what to take!</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that you can take most courses without the formal prerequisites, as long as you get the permission of the instructor (just send them an email before reading period is over!).</p>
        <p>As a general rule, if you took AP Calculus AB in high school, that covers similar content to the "Calculus I" topic. If you took AP Calculus BC in high school, that covers similar content to the "Calculus II" topic. So for example, if you took Calc BC, you might want to dive straight into a Calculus III course like Math 0200. Finally, if you did IB Calculus, you are most likely prepared for Calculus III, however IB math does not cover infinite series (covered in Calculus II), so be prepared to learn that on the side if needed either in Calculus III or later on in your STEM coursework.</p>
        <p>If you do not want or need to take calculus but do want to take a Math/APMA course, other options are Linear Algebra (great for Computer Science concentrators or people interested in data science), Statistics (great for pretty much anyone), or differential equations (great for people interested in modeling real-world phenomena, such as population dynamics). However, most of these courses have some level of calculus as a prerequisite.</p>
        <p>There are some subtopics that these courses rely upon that you did not learn in your high school calculus course. This does not always mean you should not be in that course! Some things you can do in this situation are:
            <ul class='browser-default'>
                <li>Email the professor asking how important the material is to learn</li>
                <li>Learn the subtopic on your own, using a resource like <a href="https://youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, or a textbook.</li>
                <li>Ask a friend for help! A lot of Brown students have taken a few calc/linear algebra courses and are hopefully willing to help you through hard spots.</li>
            </ul>
