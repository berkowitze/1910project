<p>MATH 0060 and MATH 0090 cover roughly the same topics but the former is a slower-paced class offered in the spring semester as the second class in an easier introductory sequence, whereas MATH 0090 is a faster-paced intro to calculus I offered in the fall semester. MATH 0070, on the other hand, is more applicable to social science or humanities majors and deals with applications to those fields.</p>
