<p>This intro to Calculus serves as an important requirement for a large number of science and mathematics students who did not take calculus in high school. Topics include limits, derivatives (including the chain, quotient and product rules) and their applications (including maxima and minima), and integration and its applications (including areas under curves and volumes of revolution). This class is intended for students with some mathematical background (precalculus, trigonometry, and algebra II are helpful topics). Experience in calculus is not required!</p>
