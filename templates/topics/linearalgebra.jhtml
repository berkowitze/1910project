<p>We recommend students only take MATH 540 if they are interested in pursuing a pure math concentration. If you are less interested in theory and proofs, it is not the class for you! MATH 520 provides an equally strong grounding in linear algebra, and will well-prepare you for future applications of the key concepts.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that, while MATH 540 is a larger lecture, and often includes a lot of proofs, MATH 520 has many more sections, some of which are taught by graduate students and thus capped at ~30 students. If you work better within smaller classrooms settings, this may be another reason to take MATH 520.</p>
<p>Note that you <strong>do not need to know a lot of calculus</strong> to take linear algebra. The amount of calculus you are comfortable with depends on the professor, so you should ask and brush up on the needed topics.</p>

<p>There are some topics you should be comfortable with before taking 520 or 540 though:</p>
