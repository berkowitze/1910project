<p>This class is meant for students inclined towards a purer form of mathematics over applied mathematics. It covers the same topics as MATH 0180/0200 but includes the teaching and testing of proofs of theorems that are not a part of the other calculus III courses. More time-consuming than MATH 0180/0200.</p>
