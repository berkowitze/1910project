<p>MATH 0100 and MATH 0190 cover the same topics, but the latter is more suited to the needs of physics and engineering students.</p>

<p>To take a Calc II level course, you should be familiar with all topics required to take a Calc I course AND all topics covered in a Calc I course. In particular, focus on:</p>

<ul class='browser-default'>
    <li>Limit definition of derivatives</li>
    <li>Derivatives</li>
    <li>Integrals</li>
    <li>Calc I level concepts can be brushed up on <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/serra/extra-practice-worksheets-calc-abbc">this site</a> under the "Calc AB" section.</li>
    <li>Comfort with trigonometric identities will be very helpful! You may need to memorize some of these but probably not all. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4mcja8abDc">Brushup 1 (patrickJMT)</a>, <a href="https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/djoyce/trig/identities.html">Brushup 2 (Clark University)</a></li>
    <li>Summations will be helpful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwXThH6fg4">Brushup (Khan Academy)</a></li>
