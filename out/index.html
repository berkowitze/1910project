    <h3>Intro Math Courses at Brown</h3>
    <div class='intro'>
        <p>There are dozens of introductory level math and applied math courses at Brown. Figuring out which ones you're qualified for and deciding which one to take can be extremely frustrating. Hopefully this site can help you figure out what to take!</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that you can take most courses without the formal prerequisites, as long as you get the permission of the instructor (just send them an email before reading period is over!).</p>
        <p>As a general rule, if you took AP Calculus AB in high school, that covers similar content to the "Calculus I" topic. If you took AP Calculus BC in high school, that covers similar content to the "Calculus II" topic. So for example, if you took Calc BC, you might want to dive straight into a Calculus III course like Math 0200. Finally, if you did IB Calculus, you are most likely prepared for Calculus III, however IB math does not cover infinite series (covered in Calculus II), so be prepared to learn that on the side if needed either in Calculus III or later on in your STEM coursework.</p>
        <p>If you do not want or need to take calculus but do want to take a Math/APMA course, other options are Linear Algebra (great for Computer Science concentrators or people interested in data science), Statistics (great for pretty much anyone), or differential equations (great for people interested in modeling real-world phenomena, such as population dynamics). However, most of these courses have some level of calculus as a prerequisite.</p>
        <p>There are some subtopics that these courses rely upon that you did not learn in your high school calculus course. This does not always mean you should not be in that course! Some things you can do in this situation are:
            <ul class='browser-default'>
                <li>Email the professor asking how important the material is to learn</li>
                <li>Learn the subtopic on your own, using a resource like <a href="https://youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, or a textbook.</li>
                <li>Ask a friend for help! A lot of Brown students have taken a few calc/linear algebra courses and are hopefully willing to help you through hard spots.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>This course is designed for students who may not have as much background in math or are not comfortable enough with the background they do have to go into a introductory calculus course.</p>
<p>To be able to take this class, the prerequisite knowledge is knowing how to solve algebraic equations with one variable. If you are uncomfortable with this, but still want to take MATH 0050, it's a good idea to go over this Khan Academy series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpCJyQ2usJ4&list=PL7AF1C14AF1B05894">Youtube Link</a></p>

        <p>MATH 0060 and MATH 0090 cover roughly the same topics. The former is the second course in the 0050/0060 sequence and is meant to be lighter in workload. MATH 0090 is a faster-paced intro to Calculus I offered both semesters.</p>
<p>MATH 0070, on the other hand, is more directed to social science or humanities concentrators and deals with applications to those fields.</p>
<p>In order to take 70 or 90, you should be comfortable with the following skills (don't worry, you can brush up on any of them!)</p>
<ul class='browser-default'>

        <p>MATH 0100 and MATH 0190 cover the same topics, but the latter is more suited to the needs of physics and engineering students. Math 0190 does not necessarily have more engineering/physics focused problems, but instead focuses on topics and skills that are more often needed in the engineering/physics fields. For example, 0190 focuses more on paths in 2 and 3 dimensions and differential equations than in Math 0100.</p>

<p>To take a Calc II level course, you should be familiar with all topics required to take a Calc I course AND all topics covered in a Calc I course. In particular, focus on:</p>

<ul class='browser-default'>
    <li>Limit definition of derivatives</li>
    <li>Derivatives</li>
    <li>Integrals</li>
    <li>Calc I level concepts can be brushed up on <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/serra/extra-practice-worksheets-calc-abbc">this site</a> under the "Calc AB" section.</li>
    <li>Comfort with trigonometric identities will be very helpful! You may need to memorize some of these but probably not all. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4mcja8abDc">Brushup 1 (patrickJMT)</a>, <a href="https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/djoyce/trig/identities.html">Brushup 2 (Clark University)</a></li>

        <p>Calculus III is a course on multivariable calculus, or the study of calculus in multiple dimensions. For example you will be finding volumes of three dimensional shapes or learning how flows move through different surfaces.</p>

<p>MATH 0180 and MATH 0200 cover the same topics, but the latter is more suited to the needs of physics and engineering students. MATH 0350 is intended for students leaning towards pure mathematics and involves the teaching and testing of proofs of theorems. This class thus is more time-consuming and for many students more difficult than its less proof heavy counterpart, MATH 0180.</p>

<p>If you've taken a Calculus II course, you should be prepared for Calculus III. You can brush up on Calc I/II on <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/serra/extra-practice-worksheets-calc-abbc">this site</a></p>

<p>Parts of Calc I/II to be most comfortable with are:</p>
<ul class='browser-default'>
    <li>Limit definition of derivative.</li>
    <li>Derivatives and integrals.</li>
    <li>Anything that happened in three dimensions (for example, surfaces of revolution).</li>
    <li>Vectors are taught at the beginning of these courses, but having an intuition for them off the bat can be helpful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgqsM-XdBD0">Quick video 1 (Khan Academy)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs">quick video 2 (3blue1brown, don't watch the next part unless you want to learn linear algebra)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAv3bF2GznI">long video (Professor Leonard - great resource throughout Calc III)</a></li>

        <p>We recommend students only take MATH 540 if they are interested in pursuing a pure math concentration. If you are less interested in theory and proofs, it is not the class for you! MATH 520 provides an equally strong grounding in linear algebra, and will well-prepare you for future applications of the key concepts.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that, while MATH 540 is a larger lecture, and often includes a lot of proofs, MATH 520 has many more sections, some of which are taught by graduate students and thus capped at ~30 students. If you work better within smaller classrooms settings, this may be another reason to take MATH 520.</p>
<p>Note that you <strong>do not need to know a lot of calculus</strong> to take linear algebra. The amount of calculus you are comfortable with depends on the professor, so you should ask and brush up on the needed topics.</p>

<p>There are some topics you should be comfortable with before taking 520 or 540 though:</p>

        <p>The Applied Mathematics concentration and its affiliates (e.g., APMA-CS, APMA-ECON) all strongly recommend students take the 350/360 track instead of the 330/340 track. The later is intended for students who need knowledge of ODEs/PDEs, but do not necessarily intend to explore the topic much deeper in the future. For example, many engineers take this sequence. While we strongly recommend intended APMA concentrators take the 350/360 sequence because later classes build on the subject matter, this may be less important for dual concentrators. For example, there are many high-level APMA-ECON classes that do not require these as a prerequisite.</p>

<p>To take an ODE course, you should be comfortable with the following topics:</p>

<ul class='browser-default'>
    <li>Derivatives. In particular, the chain rule is very useful in differential equations.</li>
    <li>Integration. In particular, integration by substitution and by parts. You should be comfortable with most of the integrals discussed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh__n9FVKA0&list=PLVwvyzz17cDI9d-P8FN69xr2zDz4bSuHF">this playlist</a>.</li>

        <p>See the ODE section for more on which PDE course you should take.</p>

<p>Partial Differential Equations deal with the study of differential equations in multiple dimensions. For example, you might look at how heat evolves on a sheet of metal where one corner is being heated. For examples of PDEs and relevant applications, see <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialDifferentialEquation.html">Wolframâ€™s guide</a>.</p>

<p>To take a PDE course, you should have a solid grounding in calculus, ordinary differential equations and linear algebra. Be comfortable with matrix operations, finding determinants of matrices, matrix equations, matrix inversion, and matrix transposition.

        <p>For a firm grounding in statistics, we recommend students take APMA 1650. While APMA 650 provides a cursory introduction of the subject, it is predominantly intended for non-concentrators or students who will not need to use much statistics later in their college career. If you intend to be any sort of APMA concentrator, 1650 is required for many upper-level classes, and cannot be substituted with 650.<br/><br/>If you want an extra challenge, APMA 1655 includes more theory-based problems and is slightly more difficult than 1650. However, there is no difference in your preparedness level for other APMA classes down the line.</p>

<p>Although no pre-existing statistics knowledge is necessary for any of these classes, it may be useful to review if you already have grounding in the material from high school. This may be particularly useful for APMA 1650/1655, as the first part of the class goes through essential statistics relatively quickly. </p>

<p>If you have some statistics background, review areas include <a href="http://makemeanalyst.com/normal-distribution-binomial-distribution-poisson-distribution/">discrete distributions</a>, significance testing, regression, sampling, and probability. Check out the AP Statistics review on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/randomness-probability-simulation/v/basic-probability">Khan Academy</a> for some helpful videos that cover these topics.</p>

<p>It will also be helpful to be comfortable with some simple derivatives and integrals; see <a href="http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~eric/Derivative%20Worksheet.pdf">this link</a> for derivatives, and <a href="https://www.hollandcsd.org/cms/lib/NY19000531/Centricity/Domain/129/Basic%20Integration%20Problems.pdf">this link</a> for integrals. <strong>You do not need to be that comfortable in derivatives and integrals, but they will come up</strong>.</p>
