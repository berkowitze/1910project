<p>Calculus III is a course on multivariable calculus, or the study of calculus in multiple dimensions. For example you will be finding volumes of three dimensional shapes or learning how flows move through different surfaces.</p>

<p>MATH 0180 and MATH 0200 cover the same topics, but the latter is more suited to the needs of physics and engineering students. MATH 0350 is intended for students leaning towards pure mathematics and involves the teaching and testing of proofs of theorems. This class thus is more time-consuming and harder than its proof-devoid counterpart, MATH 0180. Recommended for students concentrating in mathematics (not applied mathematics).</p>

<p>If you've taken a Calculus II course, you should be prepared for Calculus III. You can brush up on Calc I/II on <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/serra/extra-practice-worksheets-calc-abbc">this site</a></p>

<p>Parts of Calc I/II to be most comfortable with are:</p>
<ul class='browser-default'>
    <li>Limit definition of derivative.</li>
    <li>Derivatives and integrals.</li>
    <li>Anything that happened in three dimensions (for example, surfaces of revolution).</li>
    <li>Vectors are taught at the beginning of these courses, but having an intuition for them off the bat can be helpful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgqsM-XdBD0">Quick video 1 (Khan Academy)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs">quick video 2 (3blue1brown, don't watch the next part unless you want to learn linear algebra)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAv3bF2GznI">long video (Professor Leonard - great resource throughout Calc III)</a></li>
