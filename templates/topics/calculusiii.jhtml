<p>MATH 0180 and MATH 0200 cover the same topics, but the latter is more suited to the needs of physics and engineering students. MATH 0350 is intended for students leaning towards pure mathematics and involves the teaching and testing of proofs of theorems. This class thus is more time-consuming and harder than its proof-devoid counterpart, MATH 0180. Recommended for students concentrating in mathematics (not applied mathematics).</p>
