<p>This calculus II course carries on from the calculus fundamentals learnt in MATH 0090 and thus requires it or an equivalent high-school level calculus experience as a pre-requisite. Most students take this class as a requirement for their concentration. Topics include those taught in MATH 0090 in greater detail, such as integration by parts and substitution, extended applications of integrals, three-dimensional coordinate systems and vectors, polar and parametric equations, as well as sequences and series (including Taylor and Power series). Recommended for students without a strong high school Calculus BC experience. </p>
