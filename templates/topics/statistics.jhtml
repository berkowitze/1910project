<p>For a firm grounding in statistics, we recommend students take APMA 1650. While APMA 650 provides a cursory introduction of the subject, it is predominantly intended for non-concentrators or students who will not need to use much statistics later in their college career. If you intend to be any sort of APMA concentrator, 1650 is required for many upper-level classes, and cannot be substituted with 650.<br/><br/>If you want an extra challenge, APMA 1655 includes more theory-based problems and is slightly more difficult than 1650. However, there is no difference in your preparedness level for other APMA classes down the line.</p>

<p>Although no pre-existing statistics knowledge is necessary for any of these classes, it may be useful to review if you already have grounding in the material from high school. This may be particularly useful for APMA 1650/1655, as the first part of the class goes through essential statistics relatively quickly. </p>

<p>If you have some statistics background, review areas include <a href="http://makemeanalyst.com/normal-distribution-binomial-distribution-poisson-distribution/">discrete distributions</a>, significance testing, regression, sampling, and probability. Check out the AP Statistics review on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/randomness-probability-simulation/v/basic-probability">Khan Academy</a> for some helpful videos that cover these topics.</p>

<p>It will also be helpful to be comfortable with some simple derivatives and integrals; see <a href="http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~eric/Derivative%20Worksheet.pdf">this link</a> for derivatives, and <a href="https://www.hollandcsd.org/cms/lib/NY19000531/Centricity/Domain/129/Basic%20Integration%20Problems.pdf">this link</a> for integrals. <strong>You do not need to be that comfortable in derivatives and integrals, but they will come up</strong>.</p>
