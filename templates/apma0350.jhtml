<p>Pre-reqs: MATH 520/540 must be taken before, or congruently, with this class </p>
<p>Students taking APMA 350 should have a fairly good grasp of multivariate calculus. While Linear Algebra can be taken congruently, it helps to come into the class with pre-existing knowledge of linear algebra.</p>
