<p>For a firm grounding in statistics, we recommend students take APMA 1650. While APMA 650 provides a cursory introduction of the subject, it is predominantly intended for non-concentrators or students who will not need to use much statistics later in their college career. If you intend to be any sort of APMA concentrator, 1650 is required for many upper-level classes, and cannot be substituted with 650.<br/><br/>If you want an extra challenge, APMA 1655 includes more theory-based problems and is slightly more difficult than 1650. However, there is no difference in your preparedness level for other APMA classes down the line.</p>
