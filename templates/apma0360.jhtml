<p>This is the second in the APMA 350/360 sequence. It is intended for APMA concentrators or dual concentrators. APMA 360 in particular is highly dependent on the professor. Different professors discuss different applications of the material (for example, engineering professors may emphasize physics applications). The problem sets are more time consuming and difficult than those in APMA 350. </p>
