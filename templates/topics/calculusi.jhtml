<p>MATH 0060 and MATH 0090 cover roughly the same topics. The former is the second course in the 0050/0060 sequence and is meant to be lighter in workload. MATH 0090 is a faster-paced intro to Calculus I offered both semesters.</p>
<p>MATH 0070, on the other hand, is more directed to social science or humanities concentrators and deals with applications to those fields.</p>
<p>In order to take 70 or 90, you should be comfortable with the following skills (don't worry, you can brush up on any of them!)</p>
