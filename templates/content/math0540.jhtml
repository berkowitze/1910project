<p>See MATH 520. MATH 540 provides a more rigorous version of the material, and includes more theory. Students should only take this class if they are interested in the pure math track, or theory more generally. APMA concentrators do not need MATH 540, and should take MATH 520 for an equally good foundation in linear.</p>
