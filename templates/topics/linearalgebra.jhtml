<p>We recommend students only take MATH 540 if they are interested in pursuing a pure math concentration. Honors linear is good for students interested in a pure math track, but if you are less interested in theory and proofs it is not the class for you! MATH 520 provides an equally strong grounding in linear algebra, and will well-prepare you for future applications of the key concepts.<br/><br/>It is also worth noting that, while MATH 540 is a larger lecture, and often includes a lot of proofs, MATH 520 has many more sections, some of which are taught by graduate students and thus capped at ~30 students. If you work better within smaller classrooms settings, this may be another reason to take MATH 520.</p>
